        <p> Twenty Five, Twenty One (2521) is one of the most buzz-worthy K-dramas. It stars Kim Tae-ri as Na Hee-Do, Nam Joo-Hyuk as Back Yijin, and idol group WSJN’s Bona as Ko Yu-Rim.

            The story is set in two timelines, 1998 and 2022, capturing parallels between South Korea’s International Monetary Fund (IMF) Crisis and the present-day’s COVID-19 situation.
            
            It wrapped up with 16 episodes, which are currently available to watch (or rewatch) on Netflix.</p>

                —Na Hee Do (Twenty-five, Twenty-one)</b></i></p>

                <p>"Twenty-Five Twenty-One" is packaged as a teen story told in two timelines. Then and now. The protagonist from back then is today's mother. Today she is at odds with her daughter, who wants to give up her ballet career. In her grandmother's house, the rebellious teenager finds access to her mother's youthful past, who in turn also had difficulties with her mother at the time, yet courageously pursued her dream of becoming a fencer on the national team.

                    Romantic feelings are inevitable as the story progresses. Yet this storyline develops quite idiosyncratically beyond expectations, not least because of the two timelines told in parallel. Here, Love is shown more in the quality of an inspiring, encouraging, empowering 'rainbow', as the two protagonists so nicely state. It's a shame that you can't leave love like that, but sooner or later want to capture it, tie it down and pack it into a rather common concept of 'partnership' - with all the expectations and disappointments that come along with it...</p>
                    <br>
                <p>The ending may not be everyone’s cup of tea but I like that it is meaningful, realistic and bittersweet but with proper closure. I encountered so many emotions watching this drama and I’m not complaining. I enjoyed the ride from beginning to end. At the end of it all, it’s about how important each person is in your journey, friends or lovers, in wherever you’re going in life.</p>
                <br>
                <p> Will I recommend this? Yes! In fact I am rewatching it a second time, now with a relaxed heart and mind.</p>
